I am a lecturer and postdoctoral researcher at the [University of L\"ubeck, Germany](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) working in the [Medical Deep Learning Lab](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/en/research/medical-deep-learning-lab.html) (headed by Prof. Mattias Heinrich) of the [Institute of Medical Informatics](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/en/institute.html).

My research is at intersection of computer vision, robotics, machine learning and medical technology. I mainly focus on geometric vision and deep learning for navigation tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping for endoscopic applications as well as 2D-3D registration.

Before joining the [Medical Deep Learning Lab](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/en/research/medical-deep-learning-lab.html) I worked at [Fraunhofer MEVIS](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de) and [SICK](https://www.sick.com/de/de/).

I completed a PhD in robotics focusing on semantic models for localization and mapping under supervision of Prof. Erik Maehle at the [Institute of Computer Engineering](https://www.iti.uni-luebeck.de) of [University of L\"ubeck, Germany](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) in 2018.
