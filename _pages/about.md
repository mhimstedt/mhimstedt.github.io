I am an associate professor for computer science at the [Technical University of Applied Sciences L端beck, Germany](https://www.th-luebeck.de/). 

My research is at intersection of computer vision, robotics and machine learning. I mainly focus on geometric vision and deep learning for navigation tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure from motion (SfM) and more generally image registration. I currently work on applications of SLAM and SfM for endoscopy as well as registration for image guided therapies.

Before joining the [TH L端beck, Germany](https://www.th-luebeck.de/) I worked as professor at the [DHSH](https://www.dhsh.de), as post-doc at the [Medical Deep Learning Lab](https://www.imi.uni-luebeck.de/en/research/medical-deep-learning-lab.html) as well as [Fraunhofer MEVIS](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de). I also worked as R&D Engineer with  [SICK](https://www.sick.com/de/de/).

I completed a PhD in robotics focusing on semantic models for localization and mapping under supervision of Prof. Erik Maehle at the [Institute of Computer Engineering](https://www.iti.uni-luebeck.de) of [University of L端beck, Germany](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/universitaet/universitaet.html) in 2018.
