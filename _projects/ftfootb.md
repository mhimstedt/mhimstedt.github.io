The use of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) is of great advantage in manufacturing and logistics environments. Instead of manual transport, goods are moved safely and without human intervention using automated guided carts. This results in a significant increase in process efficiency and cost savings. Until now, existing solutions are either partially or fully autonomous. In semi-autonomous systems, the loading and unloading of transport goods was controlled manually by an operator, with operation being less intuitive and requiring special employee qualifications. The fully autonomous systems were associated with high implementation costs, as special software solutions and changes in the infrastructures of the warehouses are required and the vehicles can, for example, only follow predefined routes that have to be set up manually. For this reason, FTF out-of the-box aims to develop intelligent, driverless transport vehicles that can understand and interpret gesture or voice instructions. Having passed an initial human-controlled teach-in drive, the vehicles automatically pick up and drop pallets from racks and reloading areas based on operator commands without using any infrastructural setups.
