The project AutoSAFE addresses ultrasound diagnostics for fracture diagnosis in children as part of point of care diagnostics (POCUS) for pediatric emergency settings. 
AutoSAFE aims at a high degree of automation and standardization using artificial intelligence. In contrast to common X-ray solutions, ultrasound-based fracture diagnostics is readily available on the bedside omitting pain and radiation exposure for children. The goal is to establish an guidance system that supports the examiner in diagnosing in real time in an optimized and precise manner and, in particular, independently of the examiner's own previous experience.
