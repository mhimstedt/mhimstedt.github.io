The project AutoSAFE addresses ultrasound diagnostics for fracture diagnosis in children as part of point of care diagnostics (POCUS) for pediatric emergency settings. 
AutoSAFE aims at a high degree of automation and standardization using artificial intelligence. In contrast to common X-ray solutions, ultrasound-based fracture diagnostics is readily available on the bedside omitting pain and radiation exposure for children. The goal is to establish a guidance system that supports physicians in diagnosing in real-time in an optimized and precise manner while being independent of the examiner's ultrasound experience.
