I<sup>2</sup>MSAS aims at setting up a robot assistant for the Dresden Technical Collections. In the first phase, it is planned to use the robot as a mobile intelligent reception system welcoming museum visitors while pointing attention to special features of the current exhibitions and providing general information about the museum. Subsequently, the robot will be integrated into various special exhibitions of the museum. Thus, it offers ideal conditions for the presentating individual exhibits and the overall exhibition augmenting stationary exposition through the use of augmented reality and intelligent dialog systems. The navigation stack faces particular challenges due to substantial changes of the environment mainly caused by rearrangements of exhibits and (large groups of) visitors.
