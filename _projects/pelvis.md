[PELVIS](https://ki-sigs.de/projekt/AP%20370) is a sub-project of the large [KI-SIGS](https://ki-sigs.de) consortia. 

The project investigates interventional support for the repositioning of bone fragments in pelvic fractures. The main goal is to optimize and support surgeries of fractured pelvis using AI-assisted repositioning based on X-ray stereotaxy as an alternative to complex full navigation systems. PELVIS further addresses the development of suitable AI methods for establishing 2D-3D correspondences from intraoperative CT data and a limited number of intraoperative X-ray images.
